# Predicting-Loan-Delinquency-using-Machine-Learning
Classifying Loans based on risk of defaulting using various classification algorithm.

A typical Classification Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This solution is aimed at predicting Loan Delinquency based on risk of defaulting and other given features.

The output algorithms have been used to test if they can maintain their accuracy in predicting the loan delinquency for data they havenâ€™t been trained. Four algorithms have been used:

1) KNN CLassifier.
2) Decision Tree Classifier.
3) Support Vector Machine Classifier.
4) Logistic Regression.
